## Introduction

This guide explains how to create a Q&A bot based on a knowledge base using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Monkeys core components installed and configured
- Knowledge base with relevant data

## Steps

### Step 1: Create a Knowledge Base

1. In the Monkeys console, navigate to the **Data** section.
2. Click on **Create** to create a new knowledge base.
3. Upload your documents or data to the knowledge base.

### Step 2: Configure the Q&A Bot

1. In the Monkeys console, navigate to the **Workflows** section.
2. Create a new workflow and select the **Q&A Bot** template.
3. Configure the workflow to use the knowledge base created in Step 1.

### Step 3: Test the Q&A Bot

1. In the Monkeys console, navigate to the **Test** section.
2. Enter a question related to the knowledge base data.
3. Verify that the Q&A bot retrieves relevant information from the knowledge base and generates an appropriate response.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can create a Q&A bot based on a knowledge base using the RAG approach. This allows you to leverage existing data to provide accurate and relevant answers to user queries.
